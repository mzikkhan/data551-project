# Team work contract

## Purpose

This team contract outlines how our group will collaborate, communicate, and manage responsibilities throughout the project. The goal of this agreement is to ensure fairness, accountability, and high-quality work while maintaining a positive and professional working relationship.

---

## 1. How will work be distributed in a fair and equitable way?

- Work will be distributed in a fair and equitable manner.
- The project will be broken down into a list of clearly defined tasks.
- Tasks will be assigned evenly among team members based on workload, estimated duration, and individual skill sets to ensure balanced contribution.

---

## 2. What are the expected work hours for the project?

Each team member is expected to contribute approximately **3.5 hours per week** to the project.

---

## 3. How often will group meetings occur (here is a video on meetings)?

The team will meet **twice per week** to review progress, discuss challenges, and plan upcoming tasks.

---

## 4. Will you have meeting agendas and minutes? If so, what will be the system for rotating through these responsibilities?

Yes, we will have structured meetings.

- Agendas will be collaboratively decided by team members prior to meetings.
- Meeting minutes will be automatically recorded using Slack AI to ensure accurate documentation and transparency.

## 5. What will be the style of working?

## 6. Will you start each day with stand-ups, or submit a summary of your contributions 4 hours before each meeting? or something else?

- We will not conduct daily stand-ups.
- Instead, we will maintain a **shared contributions file** that summarizes the work completed each week. This ensures accountability and transparency without requiring daily updates.

---

## 7. What is the quality of work each team member expects from themselves and each other?

Each team member commits to delivering work at the highest standard possible (self-rated expectation: **10/10 quality**).

We expect:
